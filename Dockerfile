# Every one of these is optional except package.json, and the trailing `*` is
# what says so: a COPY whose glob matches nothing succeeds, while a bare name
# that is absent fails the build. `bunfig.toml` learned that the hard way — it
# held only `[test] preload`, which is Bun test-runner config that never ran
# because the test script is vitest, so it was deleted as dead config and this
# line failed the image build on the next push.
